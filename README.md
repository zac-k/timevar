# You can acquire data in either constant time (time is your independent variable and the number of counts is the dependent variable) or constant count (the number of counts is the independent variable and the time is the dependent variable). You should recall from previous experiments that for a fixed time, the best estimation of the uncertainty in the number of counts, NN, is N−−√N. If you acquire to a fixed number of counts, what is the uncertainty in the measured time (due to the statistical nature of nuclear decay)?

This is a question in one of our level three lab sripts, that we TAs were having difficulty working out
